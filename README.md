# MODDING
you can choose "desktop" to make a mod for the pc version or the "android" version to make a mod for android
FOR IOS go back to "main" because you cant make a mod for ios

![versionexamplev9code](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c61c50a-1232-41e4-90c7-5a5f3f2cae7d)

to change what version you want it on you can change the "versions.v1" to like "versions.v2", "versions.v3", "versions.v4" and so on all the way up to "versions.v9" unless if you want to add a custom version
that requires some css coding and stuff
